This folder contains modified version of Renny-Byfield et al., 2014 “Persistance of sub genomes in paleopolyploid cotton after 60 my”. Many of these edits are in response to the rejection by PNAS and are marked as track changes in the latest document (dated using DD_MM_YY).

There are a number of cover letters and these were posted as presubmission enquiries to a number of journals.

The “original” PNAS submission can be found on farnsworth.eeob.iastate.edu:/data/Projects?Fractionation/ and in my iMac backup from Iowa State University.
